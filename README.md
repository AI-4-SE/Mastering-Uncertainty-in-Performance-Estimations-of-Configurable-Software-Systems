# Mastering Uncertainty in Performance Estimations of Configurable Software Systems



## Supplementary Material
[md-mape]: mape/README.md
With this web site, we provide the following material:

- [descriptions of the **subject systems** we used][md-subject-systems]
- [**additional results** of our accuracy evaluation in RQ1 & RQ2 including the absolute model][md-mape]
- [more perspective on the **uncertainty calibration** of our models][md-calibration]
 <!--- the **data** we used for our evaluation-->

We also provide [data containing the accuracies of our models as well as predicted confidence interals][md-data] as well as [an implementation of our probabilistic programming approach](code/p4.py).
